## Entities
An entity is an object within our computer system that embodies a small set of critical business rules operating on critical business data

an "entity" refers to an object with a distinct identity, meaning it can be uniquely identified and tracked throughout the system, while a "value type" (often called a "value object") lacks a distinct identity and is defined solely by its attributes
