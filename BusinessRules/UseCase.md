## Use Case
A use case is a description of the way that an automated system is used. It specifies the input to be provided by the users, the output to be returened to the user and the processing steps involved in producing that output

A use case describes application specific business rules as opposed to the Critical Business rules within the Entities

- Use case do not describe how the system appears to the user
- They describe the application specific rules that govern the interaction between the users and the Entities
- How the data gets in and out of the system is irrelevant to the use cases

A use case is an object 
It has one or more functions that implement the
application-specific business rules.
It also has data elements that include the
input data, the output data, and the references to the appropriate Entities with
which it interacts.

Entites are high level concepts they do not have any knowledge of the use cases
but use cases depends on the entities


### Why are entities high level and use cases low level?

Because use cases are specific to a single application and are closer to the inputs and outputs of the system 
Entites are the generalization that can be used in many different applications so they are farther from input and output os the systems
