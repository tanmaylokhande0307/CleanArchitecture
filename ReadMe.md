#### Object Oriented Programming
    Object Oriented Programming imposes discipline over indirect transfer of .
    Object Oriented Programing helps us to achieve Dependency Inversion
    OO is the ability, through the use of complete polymorphism to gain absolute control over every source code dependency in the system. It allows the architect to create a plugin architecture in which modules that contain the high level policies are independent to the modules that contain the low level details. The low level details are relegated to plugin modules that can be deployed and developed independenlty from the modules that contain high level policies

#### Functional Programming
    Functional Programming imposes discipline over assignment
