the NamedPoint data structure acts as though it is a derivative of the Point data structure.
This is because the order of the first two fields in NamedPoint is the same as Point. In short, NamedPoint can masquerade as Point because NamedPoint is a pure superset of Point and maintains the ordering of the members that correspond to Point.
